# Data

- [Allegheny County Property Sale Transactions](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/real-estate-sales)

  - This dataset contains data on all Real Property parcels that have sold since 2013 in Allegheny County, PA.
  - Before doing any market analysis on property sales, check the sales validation codes. Many property "sales" are not considered a valid representation of the true market value of the property. For example, when multiple lots are together on one deed with one price they are generally coded as invalid ("H") because the sale price for each parcel ID number indicates the total price paid for a group of parcels, not just for one parcel. See the Sales Validation Codes Dictionary for a complete explanation of valid and invalid sale codes.
