## An End-to-end ML pipeline to build House Value Index (HVI)for A county

Please check the bash script and run my code via
bash ./run_ml_pipeline.sh

The earlier steps in the bash script was commented out, since those steps are very slow to run. The processed datasets were saved in the cleandata2.pkl file the clean_data folder.
